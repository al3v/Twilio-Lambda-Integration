# Twilio and AWS Lambda Integration
This repo provides a step-by-step guide on 
how to use Twilio and AWS Lambda integration to 
notify team members of system issues or errors via 
phone calls. By following the procedures outlined 
in this guide, you can set up an EventBridge rule 
that triggers a Lambda function, which in turn 
integrates with Twilio to make phone calls under 
specific conditions.
